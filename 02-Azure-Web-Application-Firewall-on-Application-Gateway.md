# Exercise 2: Secure application 

### Estimated Duration: 120 Minutes

## Overview

Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure Virtual Network resources. It's a fully stateful firewall as a service with built-in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability. To learn more about Azure Firewall, refer: `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall`

Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications. Traditional load balancers operate at the transport layer (OSI layer 4 - TCP and UDP). To learn more about Application gateway, refer: `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway`

Azure Web Application Firewall provides centralized protection of your web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities. Web applications are increasingly targeted by malicious attacks that exploit commonly known vulnerabilities. SQL injection and cross-site scripting are among the most common attacks. Preventing such attacks in application code is challenging. It can require rigorous maintenance, patching, and monitoring at multiple layers of the application topology. A centralized web application firewall helps make security management much simpler. To learn more about Azure Web Application Firewall, refer: `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway`

In this lab, you will deploy an Azure Firewall and Application Gateway with WAF V2, then you will publish an application through it. You'll also test the security of the application and perform a sample attack.

## Lab Objectives

- Task 1: Configure WAF to protect your web application
- Task 2: Accessing your application using the application gateway
- Task 3: Application Gateway WAF Custom Rule to block IP
- Task 4: Attack simulation
- Task 5: Rate Limiting using Azure Front Door

## Task 1: Configure WAF to protect your web application
 
In this task, you will add a Virtual Machine as the Backend pool of the Application Gateway and also configure the Application Gateway from the firewall policy.

## Task 4: Attack simulation
     
In this task, you will be testing your application for security and performing sample attacks like XSS. Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser-side script, to a different end-user.

Since we are already blocking the Public IP of the Lab VM from accessing the web application. You will want to perform this test from your own machine’s browser. You can perform a sample attack on your application by passing this `?q=<script>` value at the end of the web application URL or IP address.

1. From your own machine's browser, access the application by putting in the **Application Gateway IP** that you looked up in Task 2.
   
    >**Note:** Your browsing URL value should look like ```http://20.169.169.81/```

     ![ss](images/updateimg-13.png)

1. Now pass the value `?q=<script>` at the end of your **Application Gateway** IP and try browsing it using browser. You can observe that the web application is accessible.
  
    >**Note:** Your browsing URL value should look like ```http://20.169.169.81/?q=<script>```
    
     ![ss](images1/updateimg-14.png)
  
1. To make your application more secure,In the Azure portal, navigate to your **FirewallVM-rg** resource group and select **ApplicationGateway** from the overview page of the resource group.
     
    ![rp](images/frgag.png)
    
1. On the **Application gateway** page, follow the details below:

    - Select **Web application firewall (1)** under **Settings**.    
     
    - Click on **firewallpolicy (2)** under **Associated web application firewall policy**.  
  
      ![config](images/agfwp.png)
 
1. On the **firewallpolicy** page, go to the **Overview (1)** blade and click on **Switch to prevention mode (2)**.

     >**Note:** Wait for the firewall policy to get updated before proceeding to the next step.

    ![](images/spm.png)
    
1. Now, navigate back to the tab where you browsed the IP Address and refresh the page. You can observe the **403 Forbidden error**.
    
    ![server error](images/error2.png)

     >**Note:** This may take a few minutes to take effect.

## Task 5: Rate Limiting using Azure Front Door
  
In this task, you will set up an Azure Front Door configuration that pools two instances of a web application that runs in different Azure regions. This configuration directs traffic to the nearest site that runs the application. Azure Front Door continuously monitors the web application. You will demonstrate automatic failover to the next available site when the nearest site is unavailable. The network configuration is shown in the following diagram:  
  
![](images/a80.png)
  
### Task 5.1: Create a Front Door for your application

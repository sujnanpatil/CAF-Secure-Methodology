# Exercise 1: Secure administration and management

### Estimated Duration: 120 Minutes

## Overview

**Azure Monitor Network Insights** provides a comprehensive and visual representation of the health and metrics of all deployed network resources through topologies, without requiring any configuration. It also offers access to network monitoring capabilities such as Connection Monitor, flow logging for network security groups (NSGs), and traffic analytics.

The topology capability of **Azure Network Watcher** allows you to view all the resources in a virtual network, the resources associated with those in a virtual network, and the relationships between these resources.

**Azure Bastion** is a fully managed service provided by Microsoft Azure that enables secure and seamless Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Secure Shell (SSH) access to virtual machines (VMs) within a virtual network (VNet) without the need for a public IP address or a virtual private network (VPN) connection.

## Lab Objectives

You will be able to complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Network Health
- Task 2: Network Topology
- Task 3: Secure Access via Bastion Host
- Task 4: Prepare the Network Watcher monitoring environment and Virtual network Flow
  
## Task 1: Network Health

In this task, you'll explore Azure Monitor and examine the resource health of various deployed resources. 

1. Navigate to the Azure portal. Using the search bar, search for **Monitor (1)** and select **Monitor (2)** from the suggestions.

1. From the sidebar, expand **Insights (1)** and select **Networks (2)**.

   ![](images/innet.png "search gateway")
   
1. On the **Network health** tab, you can customize the resource health and alerts view using filters such as **Subscription**, **Resource Group**, and **Type**. You can also use the search box to find resources and their associated resources. For example, a public IP may be associated with an application gateway. A search for the public IP's DNS name will return both the public IP and the associated application gateway.

   >**Note:** Sometimes It may take time to show the healthly(green bar) status of the resorces as shown. Please try to do **refresh**. 

1. In this, each tile represents a resource's health. The tile displays the number of instances of that resource health deployed across all selected subscriptions. 

   ![](images/E1T1S4.png "search gateway")

1. You can click on any resource to select the resource view. The resource view helps you visualize how a resource is configured. The resource view is currently available for **Azure Application Gateway**, **Azure Firewall**, and **Bastions**. For example, for Application Gateway, you can access the resource view by selecting the Application Gateway resource name in the metrics grid view. You can do the same thing for Azure Firewall and Bastions.

   ![](./images/nwt.png)

1. Hover the mouse on the **location pointer (1)** inside **Geo Map** and then click **Expand (2)** to see the topology.

   ![](./images/expnd.png)

1. Now, you'll be able to **Visualize (1)** the topology. You can explore the different connections to understand how different resources, such as virtual machines, subnets, virtual network gateways, and other network components are interconnected and how they communicate with each other. You can also download the topology by clicking on **Download topology (2)**.

   ![](images/dtopo.png "search gateway")

## Task 3: Secure Access via Bastion Host

   ![](images/vnsrch.png "search gateway")

1. Select the **vnet** from the list.

   ![](images/vnetlist.png "search gateway")

1. From the sidebar, expand **Settings (1)** and select **Subnets (2)**. You will see that **AzureBastionSubnet (3)** is already present in the subnets. If you want to see the subnet configuration, then you can click on the **AzureBastionSubnet** subnet and **explore (4)** this.
   
   ![](images/abs.png "search gateway")

1. Now, using the search bar, search for **Virtual machines (1)** and select **Virtual machines (2)** from the suggestions.

## Task 4: Prepare the Network Watcher monitoring environment and Virtual network Flow

**Virtual network Diagnostic Logs** are platform logs in Azure that capture information about operations and events within an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) and its related resources (such as subnets, network security groups, and route tables).

**Virtual network flow logs** support connecting at the virtual network, subnet, and network interface level. They provide visibility into the network communications and can be used for analyzing network behaviour, detecting threats, and investigating security incidents.

In this task, you will create Virtual network flow logs and these configurations are used in Exercise 5, which reuses the Virtual network Flow Logs, Traffic Analytics setup, Azure Firewall, and other network resources from Exercise 1 to analyze collected traffic data. Otherwise, it may take 30–40 minutes for data to appear in Traffic Analytics.

1. Navigate to the Azure portal. Using the search bar, search for **Resource groups (1)** and select **Resource groups (2)** from the suggestions.
